# Leetcode Solutions in Golang

This repository contains solutions to the most important LeetCode problems, implemented in Go. The repository is structured into two main folders:

BruteForceSolutions: This folder includes solutions that use brute force approaches to solve problems, often focusing on simplicity and basic logic to reach a solution.

OptimizedSolutions: Here, you'll find more efficient implementations that aim to optimize time and space complexity, using advanced techniques and algorithms.

The repository is designed to help you understand the different ways to solve common LeetCode challenges and improve your problem-solving skills in Golang.
